# Open Global Batch Tracing

Consumers choose trusted brands, purchasing confidence in product safety. Before food, medicine, or cosmetics reach the shelf, they pass through dozens of entities distributed across the world. Each point in this chain can introduce risk. Product safety does not end at a single manufacturer's production line—it requires control across the entire chain within the company and upstream to raw material suppliers, downstream to distributors. Fast, reliable information exchange is necessary between systems within the company (ERP, MES, WMS) and between partners (suppliers, customers).

The global economy makes centralization of such a solution impossible. Companies operate in different countries, under different legal systems, protecting trade secrets. Current commercial solutions focus on individual systems while central hubs for integrating information between entities increase costs and discourage adoption, creating barriers where collaboration should exist. The absence of ready-made solutions combined with high costs of commercial platforms delays adoption and degrades the quality of the entire process. This occurs at the customer's expense—quality defects in products are difficult to identify at the company level due to the lack of solutions controlling the complete process. When defects are finally detected, they reach the market with delays and often arrive at the wrong distribution points.

Open Global Batch Tracing (OGBT) addresses both internal fragmentation and external rent extraction through open infrastructure. The solution transforms traceability from expensive vendor-controlled platforms to open infrastructure comparable to email—standardized protocols enabling universal interoperability without gatekeepers. Within a company, OGBT unifies warehouse, planning, and manufacturing systems into a single genealogy graph. Algorithms optimized for batch relationships enable queries across hundreds of thousands of connections in milliseconds. Root cause analysis that previously required days of forensic investigation becomes routine operational capability. Between companies, OGBT enables peer-to-peer communication through distributed ledger infrastructure, eliminating centralized intermediaries. When materials move from supplier to manufacturer to distributor, traceability data flows through an open protocol with cryptographic verification.

OGBT succeeds through economic alignment. Companies adopt for immediate internal value—unified genealogy across all systems with no licensing costs. When compliance requires supply chain integration, the external communication capability already exists within their deployment. The conversation with suppliers becomes "deploy software that solves your internal problems and enables our compliance" rather than a cost negotiation. Each deployment converts supply chain partners, creating network effects that compound for users rather than extracting to intermediaries. Regulatory requirements transform this from operational improvement to compliance necessity. FDA, EU, and food safety mandates escalate traceability enforcement annually. When OGBT becomes standard infrastructure, recalls complete in minutes, contaminated products are identified before reaching consumers, and resources redirect from platform fees to safety investments.
